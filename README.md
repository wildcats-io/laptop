Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a macOS laptop for web and mobile development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

Supported Operation System:

  * MacOS Monterey (12.01) - Apple M1 Processor

  Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
  Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildcats-io/laptop/main/mac
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.

If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/wildcats-io/laptop/issues/new).
Or, cut & paste the entire output into the issue.

If you see this error:

```sh
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? 
```

You can fix it with the following command:

```sh
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```
